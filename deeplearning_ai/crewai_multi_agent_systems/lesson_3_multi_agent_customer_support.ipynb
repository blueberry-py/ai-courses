      "1. Install CrewAI and necessary packages for your project by running the following commands:\n",
      "   - pip install crewai\n",
      "   - pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Assemble your agents with distinct roles, backstories, and enhanced capabilities like memory usage. You can create a senior researcher agent with memory by using the following code snippet:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   from crewai import Agent\n",
      "   researcher = Agent(\n",
